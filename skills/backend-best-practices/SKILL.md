# Backend best practices

Conventions for server-side TypeScript. [typescript-best-practices](../typescript-best-practices/SKILL.md) applies in full. This file covers what is specific to APIs.

Stack defaults: Hono, Drizzle, Zod.

## Default to few layers

A route handler that calls a domain function that queries the database is usually the whole stack. Add an abstraction when something concrete justifies it: a real second consumer, a deep module that hides complexity, or a boundary expected to churn. Skip ceremony added for symmetry, such as a service class per table or a repository interface with one implementation.

## Pick the contract by its consumers

- For internal or single-consumer APIs, use end-to-end types with tRPC or the Hono RPC client. Types flow, and iteration stays fast.
- For public or multi-consumer APIs, use OpenAPI with `@hono/zod-openapi`, so consumers get a spec. Accept the slower iteration as the price of a published contract.
- Either way, derive the contract from the route schemas. A hand-maintained spec is a second source of truth.

## Validate every route input

Parse every route input with Zod at the route boundary: body, params, query, and any header you read. Use `zValidator` in Hono and `input()` schemas in tRPC. Past that line, data is typed and trusted. Parse env vars once at startup with a Zod schema, so bad config crashes at boot, not mid-request.

## Map errors to HTTP in one place

Domain code throws a typed `AppError` with a coarse, closed set of codes. One `onError` maps codes to HTTP. Routes and domain functions stay free of status codes.

```ts
// errors.ts
export type ErrorCode = "not_found" | "forbidden" | "conflict" | "invalid";

export class AppError extends Error {
  constructor(
    readonly code: ErrorCode,
    message: string,
  ) {
    super(message);
  }
}

// app.ts, the one place errors become HTTP
const STATUS: Record<ErrorCode, ContentfulStatusCode> = {
  not_found: 404,
  forbidden: 403,
  conflict: 409,
  invalid: 400,
};

app.onError((err, c) => {
  if (err instanceof AppError) {
    return c.json({ error: err.code, message: err.message }, STATUS[err.code]);
  }
  console.error(err);
  return c.json({ error: "internal" }, 500);
});

// domain code, no HTTP knowledge
if (!order) throw new AppError("not_found", `Order ${id} not found`);
```

- Keep the code set coarse, around five codes. A new code must map to a distinct HTTP status or to distinct client handling. Otherwise reuse an existing code.
- Log unknown errors server-side and return a generic 500 body. Internals stay out of responses.
- When a caller must recover from a specific failure mid-flow, return a discriminated union from that function instead of throwing. Throwing is for failures that end the request.
- With tRPC, apply the same principle: map `AppError` to `TRPCError` in one place, such as an error formatter or a shared wrapper.

## Keep the schema in code, shape what leaves it

- Use Drizzle with the schema in code. Generate migrations and check them in.
- Shape responses with destructuring, not mapper layers. Pick the fields the endpoint returns, with `const { id, name, email } = user` or with `columns:` in the query. Renames stay compiler-checked one-line edits. On tables that hold sensitive columns, pick rather than rest-omit: `...rest` is a deny-list, so a column added later silently flows to clients, while a pick is an allow-list. Public contracts still get a real mapping to the promised shape.
- Wrap multi-write invariants in a transaction.
- Compute derived values with generated columns, views, defaults, or at read time, instead of writing second copies. When denormalizing for performance, give one code path ownership of the write.

## Before finishing

Re-read the full diff against the rules above and fix any drift. Adherence decays over a long session, and the diff is where it shows.
